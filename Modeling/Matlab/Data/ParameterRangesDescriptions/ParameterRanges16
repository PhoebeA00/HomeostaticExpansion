c set to 0 - naive to treg differentiation
epsilon set to 0 - Treg self replication rate

Something is growing incredibly high, It might be the self replication of activated T cells, I'm going to set a to 0 to see if that fixes it. 

epsilon can make treg population explode, but it's not just because of an epsilon value.

alpha is being constrained between 200000 to 600000. These ranges were found when I fitted alpha only to thymic derived Tregs. I am letting the model predict what the possibilities are for self replicaiton and differentiation of Tregs
